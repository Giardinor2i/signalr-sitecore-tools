What are SignalR Sitecore Tools?
===================================

Sitecore provides a set of very useful tools in \Website\sitecore\admin folder. This project upgrades a set of these tools by providing live updates using SignalR technology and a more friendly SPEAK-like styled user interface.

The following tools are included in the package:

- cache.html - a cache.aspx and a [Cache Tuner Module](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/Cache_Tuner.aspx) combined in one. 
- jobs.html - SignalR implementation of jobs.aspx displaying a list of currently running and finished jobs 

All SignalR tools provide live updates every second eliminating the need for clicking the refresh button to see updates. The SignalR tools, just like their original implementations, require administrator-level access.

As the project grows, more tools will be added.
